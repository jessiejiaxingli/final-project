			In Douglass Rushkoff's book <i>Present Shock</i>, he discusses a symptom of our modern world called "narrative collapse". 
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			He writes that narrative is a story that helps us understand our place in the world.
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			Now, with digital media, as we are constantly being bombarded with news from all over the world, there's a breakdown of our structered narrative. 
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			We are all given different narratives to believe, and if we were to imagine technology to be a pair of glasses through which to view the world, it has been tainted by capitalism and corporations. 
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			Our conventional sense of continuity has been hijacked by corporations, manipulating us into disillusionment with false promises. 
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			In his words, "it felt less like existential despair when we had a story."
