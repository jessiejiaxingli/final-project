			We live in echo chambers.

		<p class="content3">
			We stop hearing differing voices; we stop accepting any possibility that could break down our narrative.
		</p>
		<p class="content3">
			And as corporations hijack our realities, distorting what "entries" we see, we begin to live in worlds where everyone believes the same thing.
		</p>
		<p class="content3">
			Pressed to weave a narrative, we constantly update it, but when we put out our narratives, it becomes one more datapoint in database of the internet, thus losing its plausibility.
		</p>
		<p class="title">
			It polarizes us.
		</p>
		<p class="content3">
			The loss of the ability to account for changes over time closes off categories like redemption. Only narrative can relativize the meaning of words and actions, so in the world of the internet, judgements of this sort cannot be made.
		</p>
		<p class="title">
			Every entry carries equal weight.
